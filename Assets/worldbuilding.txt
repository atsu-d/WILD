NudoRadix Nurix "Bare Roots"
NudoCrusRadix Nudrius Nidryan Niran - Niranroot "Bare Leg Roots"
Albarami Albami Alden - Aldentrees  "Striped Branches"

Aldentrees: Striped trees with monstera-like leaves sprout out the top

Nirantrees: Several Niranroots that grew towards each other to intertwine in order to
combine their seeds. The new seed is then grown towards the sky and spread out via a 
networking canopy. NOT a fruit, since the tree reproduced by spreading through the canopy,
rather then relying on wildlife to disperse their seeds.
